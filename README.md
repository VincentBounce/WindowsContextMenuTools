# 🧰 Windows Context Menu Powerful Tools

Bundle of best ***Windows shell File Explorer context menu tools*** sorted and organized in cascaded menus.

- All tools are light because condensed in command-lines **using only Windows 10-11 built-in commands**.
- Each tool can be installed separately.
- These commands are written into Windows Registry when you install these tools.
- No `.exe` nor `.msi` nor `.inf` to install tools. No file copied. Instant install.
- We recommend optional upgrades like [PowerShell 7 x64 MSI] or [Windows Terminal], because these open-source projects are pushed by *Microsoft*, and will be probably built-in next releases of Windows.
- On **Windows 11**, an extra step is necessary to use these tools: from *File Explorer*, right click on selected item ➜ *Show more options*. Or select item ➜ `Shift` + `F10`. [Below instructions](#-windows-11-new-context-menu) to remove/restore this Windows 11 extra layer.

> Tested on Microsoft Windows 10/11 Pro 64-bits.

## ![wipe-free-space-icon] Overwrite deleted data

![Wipe-free-space-screenshot](/readme-images/Wipe-free-space-screenshot.png "Overwriting D:\ drive from Windows File Explorer")

- Secures all your external drives before giving them, by ensuring that all **deleted data** has been **overwritten**. Usually, even if a file is deleted and not just moved to *Recycle Bin*, this file is just **deindexed**, and entire content remains totally **recoverable** from your disk, until this content is overwritten by another file. This reason explain why deletions are so fast.

- To secure your disk without formatting, this tool calls the Windows built-in program `cipher.exe` which writes successively 3 big files to fill entire empty space, in a temporary file (`D:\EFSTMPWP\filE6A3.tmp` for example). Of course, it **keeps existing files**.

- Avoids traditional formatting, which is unsecure, and which erase unnecessarily the files you want to keep.

- Executes 3 writing sequences: a first one only with `0` bits, a second one only with `1` bits, and a third one with random bits.

- Applies on all internal and external drives, displayed in both *File Explorer* left and right panes.

- To use it, right click on your external drive ➜ *Overwrite deleted data*. When process is done, you'll see 3 full lines of 100 points each one, like screenshot above.

💿 To install this tool separately, just run `Wipe-free-space.reg` and confirm 3 dialog boxes. To install [bundle it's here](#-install-all-tools).
